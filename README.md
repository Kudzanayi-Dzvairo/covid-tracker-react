## Reflection

This project was built as a portfolio piece. I intended to demonstarte my skills with React as well as use it as an opportunity to familiarize myself with third party libraries like chart.js and material ui.  

In the this day and age with the Corona virus raging, I felt that this would be a good project to not only keep myself informed but to practice my skills. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was using Chart.js. It was a great opportunity to practice debugging and using documentation to overcome a problem. 

The technologies implemented in this project are React, Styled-Components, Charts.js, and Material UI  as well as some VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
